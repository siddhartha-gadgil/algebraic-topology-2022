1. Let `$\Gamma$` be a $1$-dimensional CW complex and let `$X$` be a CW-complex. Consider a map `$f: \Gamma\to X$`. Then prove or disprove the following.
    * __(a)__ `$f$` must be homotopic to a map with image in the `$0$`-skeleton `$X^{(0)}$` of `$X$`.
    * __(b)__ `$f$` must be homotopic to a map with image in the `$1$`-skeleton `$X^{(1)}$` of `$X$`.

2. Fix `$n\geq 2$`. Let `$D=[0, 1]^n$` and let `$A$` and `$B$` be subsets of `$D$` given by `$$A = \{(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)\in D : \exists i, 1 \leq i \leq n, x_i \in \{0, 1\}\}$$` and `$$B =  (\{1\}\times [0, 1]^{n- 1})\cup\{(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)\in D : \exists i, 1 < i \leq n, x_i \in \{0, 1\}\}$$`
Let `$X = D / A$` and `$Y = D/ B$` be the quotients of `$D$` with `$A$` and `$B$` identified to points, respectively.
Prove or disprove the following
    * __(a)__ `$X$` is homeomorphic to the `$n$`-sphere `$S^n$`.
    * __(b)__ `$Y$` is homeomorphic to `$D$`.
