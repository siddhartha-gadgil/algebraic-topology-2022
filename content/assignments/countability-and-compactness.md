This assignment is based on material in lectures 16 and 17.

1. Recall that the Sorgenfrey line `$\mathbb{R}_l$` is the topological space with underlying set `$\mathbb{R}$` and with topology having basis `$\{[a, b): a, b\in\mathbb{R}\}$`. Let `$\{a_n\}$` be a sequence of real numbers. Prove or disprove the following.
    1. If `$\{a_n\}$` converges to `$0$` in `$\mathbb{R}$` (with its usual topology), then `$\{a_n\}$` converges to `$0$` in `$\mathbb{R}_l$.
    2. If `$\{a_n\}$` converges to `$0$` in `$\mathbb{R}_l$`,then `$\{a_n\}$` converges to `$0$` in `$\mathbb{R}$` (with its usual topology).
    3. If `$a_n=\frac{1}{n}$` for all `$n\geq 1$`,then `$\{a_n\}$` converges to `$0$` in `$\mathbb{R}_l$.
    4. If `$a_n=-\frac{1}{n}$` for all `$n\geq 1$`,then `$\{a_n\}$` converges to `$0$` in `$\mathbb{R}_l$.

2. Let `$X$` be the natural numbers with the __cofinite__ topology, and consider the sequence `$\{n\}_{n\geq 1}$` in `$X$. Prove or disprove the following.
    1. The sequence `$\{n\}_{n\geq 1}$` converges to `$0\in X$.
    2. The sequence `$\{n\}_{n\geq 1}$` converges to `$1\in X$.
    3. The sequence `$\{n\}_{n\geq 1}$` does not converge in `$X$.

3. Let `$S$` be a set. Prove or disprove the following.
    1. `$S$` with indiscrete topology is compact if and only if `$S$` is finite.
    2. `$S$` with discrete topology is compact if and only if `$S$` is finite.
    3. `$S$` with indiscrete topology is always compact.
    4. `$S$` with discrete topology is always compact.

4. Let `$X$` be an infinite set with the discrete metric. Prove or disprove the following for a subset `$A\subset X$`.
    1. If `$A$` is compact then `$A$` is closed and bounded.
    2. If `$A$` is closed and bounded then `$A$` is compact.

5. Let `$(X, \leq)$` be an ordered set giving a topological space with the order topology. Prove or disprove the following.
    1. If `$X$` is sequentially compact, then every bounded monotonic sequence in `$X$` is convergent.
    2. If every bounded monotonic sequence in `$X$` is convergent, then `$X$` is sequentially compact.
