<h2>Online lectures</h2>
<p>Lectures are slide-shows consisting of videos (screencasts) mostly alternating with quizzes. You can make the videos
    full-screen.
    It is recommended that you watch with "quality" at least 720p to avoid fuzzy writing (click on the setting at the
    bottom of the YouTube video to specify this).</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture1.html" target="_blank">Lecture 1:</a> <strong>Introduction.</strong>
        <p>We begin with introductory remarks on topological properties and spaces. We then give a precise definition of 
            topological spaces and give the simplest examples.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture2.html" target="_blank">Lecture 2:</a> <strong>Some topological spaces.</strong>
        <p>We give examples of topological spaces, including the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture3.html" target="_blank">Lecture 3:</a> <strong>Bases for topology.</strong>
        <p>A topology can be described using a <em>basis</em>. We define 
            basis for a topology and give some examples.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture4.html" target="_blank">Lecture 4:</a> <strong>Metric spaces, subspaces.</strong>
        <p>We define metric spaces and see some important examples.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture5.html" target="_blank">Lecture 5:</a> <strong>Hausdorff distance, ultra-metrics</strong>
        <p>We introduce some important examples: <em>the Hausdorff distance</em> and the <em>Cantor set</em> viewed as an <em>ultra-metric</em>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture6.html" target="_blank">Lecture 6:</a> <strong>Subsets and points.</strong>
        <p>We define the <em>subspace topology</em> on a subset. We study the relation between subsets and points, defining <em>interiors</em>, <em>closures</em> and frontiers of sets.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture7.html" target="_blank">Lecture 7:</a> <strong>Continuity.</strong>
        <p>We define continuity for functions between topological spaces and give the first examples.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture8.html" target="_blank">Lecture 8:</a> <strong>Local criteria for continuity.</strong>
        <p>We characterize continuity in terms of conditions near each point, and in terms of neighbourhood bases. Using this, we study functions to $\mathbb{R}$.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture9.html" target="_blank">Lecture 9:</a> <strong>More topological spaces and relations.</strong>
        <p>We describe <em>initial</em> and <em>final</em> topologies associated to collections of functions. We then describe isometric embeddings. In the final segment we study the Cantor set in detail and use it to construct <em>space-filling curves</em>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture10.html" target="_blank">Lecture 10:</a> <strong>Homeomorphisms.</strong>
        <p>We define <em>Homeomorphisms</em> and give many examples. We also describe the <em>order topology</em> associated to an ordered set.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture11.html" target="_blank">Lecture 11:</a> <strong>Pasting and Fundamental covers.</strong>
        <p>The pasting lemma gives conditions for continuous functions to be glued together to continuous functions. We prove this and show the hypothesis holds for locally closed cover.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture12.html" target="_blank">Lecture 12:</a> <strong>Connectedness.</strong>
        <p>We define connectedness, show various ways of deducing this and give examples. We show that any space decomposes into connected components.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture13.html" target="_blank">Lecture 13:</a> <strong>Applications of connectedness.</strong>
        <p>We give applications of connectedness, in particular the intermediate value theorem and showing spaces are not homeomorphic in various examples.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture14.html" target="_blank">Lecture 14:</a> <strong>Path connectedness.</strong>
        <p>We define path-connectedness and prove basic properties. We show that the <em>topologists sine curve</em> is connected but not path-connected.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture15.html" target="_blank">Lecture 15:</a> <strong>Separation properties</strong>
        <p>We define various separation properties of topological spaces. We prove two deep results giving consequences of separation properties &mdash; Urysohn lemma and Tietze extension theorem.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture16.html" target="_blank">Lecture 16:</a> <strong>Countability properties</strong>
        <p>We define <em>countability properties</em> &ndash; first and second countability and separability, of topological spaces. These are axioms that encapsulate a space not being extremely large. We derive some consequences. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="../lectures/lecture17.html" target="_blank">Lecture 17:</a> <strong>Compactness</strong>
        <p> <em>Compactness</em> is the deepest property of topological spaces, with many important consequences. We define compactness, give criteria and consequences.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="../lectures/lecture18.html" target="_blank">Lecture 18:</a> <strong>Compactness and metric spaces</strong>
        <p>We study consequences and criteria for compactness in the case of metric spaces. The most important of these is the relation between compactness and the existence of $\varepsilon$-nets.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="../lectures/lecture19.html" target="_blank">Lecture 19:</a> <strong>Compactification</strong>
        <p>A compactification of a topological space $X$ is a compact topological space in which $X$ embeds as a dense subset. We introduce the one-point compactification. We define local compactness and give consequences of the one-point compactification for locally compact Hausdorff spaces. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="../lectures/lecture20.html" target="_blank">Lecture 20:</a> <strong>Products of Spaces</strong>
        <p>
            We define the product of collections of topological spaces as a topological space. We prove many properties, in particular showing in what sense this is the correct definition.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="../lectures/lecture21.html" target="_blank">Lecture 21:</a> <strong>Products, Metrization and Compactification</strong>
        <p> 
            We study when products of metric spaces are <em>metrizable</em>, i.e., with topology the same as that induced by some metric. As a consequence of this and earlier results (Urysohn lemma) we prove the <em>Urysohn metrization theorem</em>. We also prove the Tychonoff theorem showing that arbitrary products of compact topological spaces is compact.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="../lectures/lecture22.html" target="_blank">Lecture 22:</a> <strong>Baire category theorem</strong>
        <p>
            The <em>Baire Category theorem</em> is a deep result that allows one to speak of sets being small or large in a topological sense in metric spaces. We state and prove this. As an application we show that there exists a space that is regular but not normal.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="../lectures/lecture23.html" target="_blank">Lecture 23:</a> <strong>Quotients of Spaces</strong>
        <p> 
            The geometrically most important construction of topological spaces is that of <em>quotient spaces</em>, which are spaces obtained by taking quotients under an equivalence relation. We define the quotient topology, study its properties, and give a few examples.
