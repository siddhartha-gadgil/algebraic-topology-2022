This assignment is based on material in lectures 18 and 19.

1. Consider the cover of `$X = [0, 1]$` by sets of the form `$X\cap (a, a + \frac{1}{3})$` for `$a\in \mathbb{R}$`. Find a Lesbegue number for this cover (and prove that it is a Lesbesgue number).

2. Let `$X=[0, 1]\times[0, 1]\subset\mathbb{R}^2$`. For which positive real numbers `$d> 0$` is there a constant `$C = C_d > 0$` such that for every `$\varepsilon\in (0, 1)$` there is an `$\varepsilon$`-net of size at most `$C_d(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})^d$` in `$X?$` Prove your answer.

3. Let $X$ be a topological space and let $X^*$ be its one-point compactification. Prove or disprove the following.
    1. If $X$ is compact then $X^*$ is homeomorphic to $X$.
    2. If $X$ is compact then $X^*$ is not connected.
    3. If $X$ is connected then $X^*$ is connected.

4. Give an example of a topological space `$X$` that is __not__ locally compact and prove that it is not locally compact (you may wish to consider the _SNCF metric_).
