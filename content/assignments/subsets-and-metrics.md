This assignment is based on material in lectures 5 and 6.

1. Let `$X$` be a metric space, `$x, y\in X$` points and `$A\subset X$` a subset. Prove or disprove the following.
    1. `$d(A, y) \leq d(A, x) + d(x, y)$`.
    2. `$d(x, y) \leq d(A, x) + d(A, y)$`.

2. Suppose we consider the Hausdorff distance on all bounded sets (i.e., not necessarily closed). Prove or disprove the following.
    1. `$d_H(A, B) = 0$` if and only if `$A= B$`.
    2. `$d_H(A, B) = d_H(B, A)$`.
    3. `$d_H(A, C)\leq d_H(A, B) + d_H(B, C)$`.

3. Let `$A$` be the subset of the Cantor set `$X$` with `$A$` consisting of sequences `$\{a_n\}$` such that  `$a_n= 0$` for all but finitely many `$n$`. Prove or disprove the following.
    1. `$A$` is open in `$X$`.
    2. `$A$` is closed in `$X$`.
    3. `$A$` intersects every open set in `$X$`.

4. Prove or disprove the following.
    1. A subspace of a space with discrete topology has discrete topology.
    2. A subspace of a space with indiscrete topology has indiscrete topology.
    3. A subspace of a space with cofinite topology has cofinite topology.
