1. Fix $n\geq 1$ and consider the partially ordered set `$$S = \{k\in \mathbb{N}: k\vert n\},$$` where $k\vert n$ means $k$ divides $n$, with the partial order given by $k\leq m$ if $k\vert m$. Let $X$ be the Poset complex associated to S. Prove or disprove the following.
    * __(a)__ `$X$` has a `$2$`-simplex if and only if `$n$` is composite.
    * __(b)__ `$X$` has a `$1$`-simplex if and only if `$n > 1$`.
    * __(c)__ `$X$` is the standard `$k$`-simplex for some `$k$` (i.e., the set of simplices is a power set) if and only if `$n$` is the power of a prime.

2. Let `$\Sigma$` be the simplicial complex  `$$\Sigma=\{\{0\}, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{0, 1\}, \{0, 2\}\}.$$`
Then prove or disprove that the geometric realization $X =\vert\Sigma\vert$ is homeomorphic to a closed interval.

3. Let `$\Sigma$` be the simplicial complex `$$\Sigma=\{\{0\}, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{0, 1\}, \{0, 2\}\}.$$`  Prove or disprove the following.
    * __(a)__ `$Z_1$` is trivial.
    * __(b)__ `$C_1$` is isomorphic to `$\Z$`.
