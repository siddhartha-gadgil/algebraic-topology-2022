##### Microsoft Teams details

A Team for this course (within IISc) named __Algebraic Topology 2022__ has been created. Anyone from IISc can also join using the Team code `8e7xdqs`,
and a link to join has been posted on  the IISc intranet (under Department of Mathematics). Lectures will be initially on Teams at the scheduled times,
and we will move offline when permitted by the IISc policy.

Assignments will be submitted through Teams. There are Teams apps available for Windows, Linux (Debian/Ubuntu and Redhat), Mac, Android and iOS. 

I would encourage using the Teams chat to ask questions whenever needed.
