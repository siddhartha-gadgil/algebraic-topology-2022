This assignment is based on material in lectures 22 and 23.

1. Let `$A\subset\mathbb{R}^2$` be the subset `$A = \{(x, y)\in \mathbb{R}^2: x\in \mathbb{Q}\}$`. Prove or disprove the following.
    1. `$A$` is dense.
    2. The complement `$\mathbb{R}^2\setminus\bar{A}$` of the closure of $A$ is a dense open set.
    3. `$A$` is the countable union of nowhere dense closed sets.

2. Let `$X$` be a topological space. Let `$\sim$` be the equivalence relation on `$X$` such that `$$x\sim y\iff x = y.$$` Prove or disprove that `$X/\sim$` is homeomorphic to `$X$`.

3. Let `$X$` be the quotient of `$[0, 1]$` by the equivalence relation `$\sim$` generated by `$x\sim (1 - x)$` for all `$x\in [0, \frac{1}{2}]$`. Prove or disprove that `$X$` is homeomorphic to `$[0, 1]$`.

4. Prove or disprove that `$\mathbb{R}P^1$` is homeomorphic to `$S^1$`.
