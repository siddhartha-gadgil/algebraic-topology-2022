This assignment is based on material in lectures 3 and 4.

1. Let `$X$` be a space with discrete topology and `$B$` a collection of subsets of `$X$`. Prove or disprove that  `$B$` is a basis _if and only if_ every singleton set `$\{x\}$`, with `$x\in X$`, is in `$B$`.

2. Which of the following form a basis for some topology on $\mathbb{R}^2$? In each case prove or disprove.
    1. All open discs centred at the origin.
    2. All open discs centred at some point $(x, 0)$ on the $x$-axis.
    3. All open discs centred at some point $(n,m)$ with $n, m\in\mathbb{Z}$.

3. Let `$X$` be a set. Show that the collection `$$\mathcal{F}= \{A \subset X: \textrm{$A$ is countable}\}\cup\{X\}$$` is the collection of __closed sets__ for some topology on `$X$`.

4. For each of the following functions `$d: \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$`, determine whether `$d$` is a metric. Prove or disprove in each case.
    1. `$d(x, y) = (x - y)^2$`.
    2. `$d(x, y) = \left|x - y\right|^{1/2}$`.

5. For each of the following functions `$d: \mathbb{R^2}\times\mathbb{R^2}\to\mathbb{R}$`, determine whether `$d$` is a metric. Prove or disprove in each case.
    1. `$d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = (x_1 - x_2)^2$`.
    2. `$d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = \min(\left|x_1 - x_2\right|, \left|y_1 - y_2\right|)$`.
