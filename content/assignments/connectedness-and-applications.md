This assignment is based on material in lectures 12, 13 and 14.

1. Determine for which of the following topologies on `$\mathbb{R}$` are the corresponding spaces connected.
    1. The indiscrete topology.
    2. The discrete topology.
    3. The standard topology.
    4. The cofinite topology.

2. Let `$X$` be a connected topological space. Prove or disprove the following.
    1. If the interior of a set `$A\subset X$` is connected then `$A$` is connected.
    2. If `$A\subset X$` is a non-empty proper subset of `$X$` (i.e., `$\phi\neq A\neq X$`) then the frontier of `$A$` is non-empty.

3. Let `$f: X \to Y$` be a continuous surjective map. Prove or disprove the following statements.
    1. If `$X$` is connected then so is `$Y$`.
    2. If `$Y$` is connected then so is `$X$`.
    3. The number of connected components of `$Y$` is greater than or equal to the number of connected components of `$X$`.
    4. The number of connected components of `$X$` is greater than or equal to the number of connected components of `$Y$`.

4. Let `$X= \{(x, y)\in\mathbb{R}^2: xy = 0\}$`. Then what are the possibilities for the number of components of `$X\setminus \{P\}$` for _some_ point `$P\in X$`. Prove your answer.

5. For which of the following spaces `$X$` is every path in `$X$` a constant path.
    1. `$X = \mathbb{Q}$` with the metric topology from `$d(x, y) = |x - y|$`.
    2. `$X =\mathbb{N}$` with the cofinite topology.
    3. `$X = \mathbb{N}$` with the indiscrete topology.
