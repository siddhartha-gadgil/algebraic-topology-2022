#### Course Details
  
* __Instructor:__ [Siddhartha Gadgil](http://math.iisc.ac.in/~gadgil)
* __E-mail:__ _siddhartha.gadgil@gmail.com_
* __Teaching Assistants:__ Pranab Sarkar, Pabitra Barman

This course will be taught online, mostly through pre-recorded [lectures](./all-lectures/). We will mostly follow the book _Elementary Topology: Problem Textbook_ by Viro et. al., which is available online. There will also be interactive sessions on Microsoft Teams.

##### Microsoft Teams details

A Team for this course (within IISc) named __Topology : August 2021__ has been created. A link to join this Team will be posted on the IISc intranet (under Department of Mathematics), and people from IISc can also join using the Team code `nq02o79`. Please join the Team if you register for the course or wish to attend interactive sessions. If you choose to leave the course after some lectures you can leave the Team.

Please download the appropriate Teams app before the first interactive session. There are Apps available for Windows, Linux (Debian/Ubuntu and Redhat), Mac, Android and iOS. Once you have joined the team, whenever I (or someone else) starts a meeting  you will see in the chat that a meeting has started. Please click to join.

The interactive sessions will be weekly on __Mondays and Wednesdays, 9:00 am to 10:00 am__, starting on __Wednesday, August 4, 2021__.

I would encourage using the Teams chat when it is set up to ask questions whenever needed.  We will also meet for interactive sessions.

##### Assignment submissions

Assignments will be posted on this web site and linked in Microsoft Teams. They have to be submitted through Microsoft Teams. The easiest way to do this is to write on paper, photograph or scan this and submit `pdf` or image files. It is recommended that you use an app like `Adobe scan` or `Microsoft Lens` to generate a single pdf file for each assignment (instead of a collection of images).

If you wish you can instead use `LaTeX` and submit `pdf` files.

#### Examinations and Grades

Due to the difficulty of online evaluation, there will be 3 term examinations as well as a final examination. These will all be written, followed by an oral section where the student must be able to explain anything in the written proof, well enough to establish to my satisfaction that the student wrote this based on understanding, not by copying. Suspicion of copying will be strongly penalized.

Grades will be based on the  assignments, midterm examinations and final examinations with the following weightages.

* __Assignments:__ 10%
* __Midterm 1:__ 15%
* __Midterm 2:__ 25%
