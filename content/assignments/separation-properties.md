This assignment is based on material in lecture 15.

1. Let `$X$` be a finite set. Prove or disprove the following.
    1. If `$X$` is Hausdorff then the topology on `$X$` is the discrete topology.
    2. If `$X$` is `$T_1$`, then the topology on `$X$` is the discrete topology.

2. Let `$X$` be a countably infinite set with the indiscrete topology. Prove or disprove the following.
    1. `$X$` is `$T_1$`.
    2. `$X$` is Hausdorff.
    3. `$X$` satisfies the third separation axiom.
    4. `$X$` satisfies the fourth separation axiom.

3. Let `$X$` be a topological space and `$f: X \to \mathbb{R}$` be a continuous map. For `$c\in \mathbb{R}$` define `$X_c = \{x\in X: f(x) < c\}$`. Prove or disprove the following.
    1. `$X_c$` is closed.
    2. `$X_c$` is open.
    3. If `$a \leq b$`, then `$X_a\subset X_b$`.
    4. If `$a < b$`, then `$\overline{X}_a\subset X_b$`.

4. For each of the following spaces `$X$`, prove or disprove: if `$Y$` is a metric space and a sequence of continuous functions `$f_n: X\to Y$` converges pointwise to a function `$f: X\to Y$`, then `$f_n$` converges uniformly to `$f$`.
    1. `$X$` is finite.
    2. `$X$` is indiscrete.
    3. `$X = [0, 1]$`.

5. For each of the following subsets `$A \subset\mathbb{R}$`, prove or disprove: every continuous map `$f: A \to [0, 1]$` extends to a continuous map from `$\mathbb{R}$` to `$[0, 1]$`.
    1. `$A = (0, 1)$`.
    2. `$A = [0, 1]\cup [2, 3]$`.
    3. `$A = \{x\in \mathbb{R}: x \leq 2\}$`.
