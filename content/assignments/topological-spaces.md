This assignment is based on material in lectures 1 and 2.

1. For sets `$A$` and `$B$`, recall that `$A\setminus B= \{a\in A: a \notin B\}$.` Which of the following always equals `$A\setminus (A \setminus B)$?` Prove your answer.
    1. `$A$`
    2. `$B$`
    3. `$A \cap B$`
    4. `$A\cup B$`

2. Let `$X=\{1, 2\}$`. What is the number of collections of subsets `$\Omega\subset X$` that form a topology on `$X$?` Prove your answer.

3. Prove that the cofinite topology on a set `$X$` equals the discrete topology if and only if `$X$` is finite.
